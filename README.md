Software Security Exam Project
This repository documents a comprehensive series of exercises and lab assignments carried out as part of a software security exam. The project covers a wide array of vulnerabilities and attack vectors, illustrating both the theory and practical exploitation techniques. Additionally, it includes an in-depth malware analysis of the Agent_Telsa virus, developed as an exam project.

Overview
The primary objective of this project is to explore critical software security challenges and develop practical solutions for mitigating them. The repository contains detailed exercises and lab reports that focus on identifying, exploiting, and mitigating common security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and various web security attacks. These exercises were designed not only to understand the mechanics behind these attacks but also to develop strategies for defending against them.

Key topics covered in the project include:

Buffer Overflows: Understanding memory manipulation vulnerabilities, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

Web Security Vulnerabilities:

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting): Techniques for injecting malicious scripts into web pages.

XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery): Strategies for fooling a user into performing actions without their consent.

SQL Injection: Methods to exploit database systems via unsanitized inputs.

Process Injection: Examining techniques used to inject code into running processes, a common tactic in advanced persistent threats.

Additionally, a comprehensive malware analysis of the Agent_Telsa virus is included, offering insights into its behavior, propagation methods, and the security implications associated with such threats.

Key Components
Lab Exercises:
The repository provides detailed write-ups and solutions for each lab assignment. Each exercise dives into a specific security vulnerability, offering a step-by-step analysis, exploitation approach, and corresponding mitigation strategies.

Malware Analysis:
An in-depth analysis of the Agent_Telsa virus is documented, including:

Behavioral Analysis: Investigation into how the virus operates and spreads.

Static & Dynamic Analysis Techniques: Tools and methodologies used to dissect the malwareâ€™s code and runtime behavior.

Security Implications: Discussion on the broader impact and countermeasures for similar threats.

Documentation & Reports:
Every lab assignment and malware analysis is supplemented with comprehensive documentation. This includes code snippets, configuration details, and observations made during testing, providing a rich resource for both learning and future reference.
